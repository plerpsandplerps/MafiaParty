During the day a living player may signify they want to attempt a s√©ance by pointing at a dead player. If the majority of the living players point at the same dead player, the group will attempt to contact them.

- If the medium is alive and pointed at the same dead player, the attempt succeeds. The agreed upon dead person can speak for the rest of the day, but cannot vote. 
-  If the medium is dead or did not point at the same dead player, the attempt fails. No other attempts may be made for the remainder of the game.
